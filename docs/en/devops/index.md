# DevOps

**DevOps** is made up of **software development** (Dev) and its **operation** (Ops). It is a method in the software engineering field that aims to combine the work of the development teams (planning &rarr; development &rarr; building process → testing) and the operations teams (publishing → deployment → operations → monitoring). The goal is to foster a culture of collaboration to improve and shorten the [application development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle).
